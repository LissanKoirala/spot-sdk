<h1>API Example - Hello Spot</h1>
<p>This example program is the introductory programming example for Spot.  It demonstrates how to initialize the SDK to talk to robot, commanding Spot to stand up, strike a pose, stand tall, sit down, and capture an image from a camera.</p>
<h2>Understanding Spot Programming</h2>
<p>For your best learning experience, please use the <a href="../../../docs/python/quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a> found in the SDK's docs/python directory.  That will help you get your Python programming environment setup properly.  Then specifically for Hello Spot, you should look at the <a href="../../../docs/python/understanding_spot_programming.html">Understanding Spot Programming</a> file in the same directory, this document walks you through all the commands found in this example!</p>
<h2>Setup Dependencies</h2>
<p>See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Common Problems</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately.  Find the e-stop programming examples.</li>
<li>Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.</li>
<li>If you have a problem with Pillow/PIL, did you run the pip install with the requirements.txt as described above?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Run the Example</h2>
<p>To run the example:</p>
<pre><code>python hello_spot.py --username=USER --password=PASSWORD --app-token=&lt;path_to_app_token&gt; ROBOT_IP
</code></pre>
<p>Note: The default path for app-token is ~/.bosdyn/dev.app_token. You should save your token there for ease of use.</p>
