<h1>API Example - Replaying a Mission</h1>
<p>This example shows how to replay a mission via the API. The user may pass a map directory and/or a mission file for Spot to play back.</p>
<p>This example assumes that Spot can see the fiducial from "Start" of your mission. To ensure the fiducial is in view, move Spot to a location where the initial fiducial is seen and verify that the fiducial has a purple overlay in the tablet camera view. You may then disconnect the tablet, engage the estop on your current device, and replay the mission.</p>
<h2>Run the Example</h2>
<p>To run the example:</p>
<pre><code>python -m replay_mission --mission &lt;path_to_mission&gt; --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
</code></pre>
