<h1>API Example - Run and interact with a RemoteMissionService.</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a gRPC server that implements the RemoteMissionService service definition</li>
<li>Connect a RemoteClient directly to that server.</li>
<li>Build a mission that talks to that server.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the new pattern used by "callback" elements of Autowalk missions.</p>
<h2>Setup Dependencies</h2>
<p>See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<h3>Running without a robot</h3>
<p>You can test the example server without involving the robot at all. Start the server with</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_service localhost
</code></pre>
<p>On success, you should see a new line on your terminal like this one:</p>
<pre><code>Starting server on port PORT (remote_mission_service.py:71)
</code></pre>
<p>To start the client, run</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_client localhost --port PORT
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>PORT</code> matches the port number printed out by the server application. The client should immediately connect to the local server, and the server and client will both print out some information.</p>
<p>The client output will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>EstablishSession is unimplemented.
Servicer stopped with status STATUS_SUCCESS
Either Stop or TeardownSession is unimplemented.
</code></pre>
<p>The server output will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Exception calling application: Method not implemented! (_server.py:400)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "site-packages/grpc/_server.py", line 392, in _call_behavior
    return behavior(argument, context), True
  File "remote_service_pb2_grpc.py", line 48, in EstablishSession
    raise NotImplementedError('Method not implemented!')
NotImplementedError: Method not implemented!
Hello World! (example_servicers.py:43)
Exception calling application: Method not implemented! (_server.py:400)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "site-packages/grpc/_server.py", line 392, in _call_behavior
    return behavior(argument, context), True
  File "remote_service_pb2_grpc.py", line 63, in Stop
    raise NotImplementedError('Method not implemented!')
NotImplementedError: Method not implemented!
</code></pre>
<p>The NotImplementedError tracebacks are normal and can be ignored. They are just telling you that the EstablishSession and Stop RPCs are not implemented in the basic servicer.</p>
<p>You can change the <code>Hello World!</code> text with an option to the client. For example, if you run the client again with the additional <code>--user-string</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_client localhost --port PORT --user-string Spot
</code></pre>
<p>The server will print out <code>Hello Spot!</code> instead of <code>Hello World!</code></p>
<h3>Running with a robot</h3>
<p>There is another example servicer that will power the robot down in a safe way. To run this example, you will need a connection between a robot and the computer running the examples. Here's an example, assuming the host running the examples is connected to the robot's WiFi network:</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_service 192.168.80.3 --servicer PowerOff --username USER --password PASSWORD
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you run the client with:</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_client localhost --port PORT --lease-host 192.168.80.3 --username USER --password PASSWORD
</code></pre>
<p>and assuming the robot is already powered off and sitting on the ground, you'll see this output from the server:</p>
<pre><code>Ticked by node "&lt;unknown&gt;" (example_servicers.py:107)
Ticked by node "&lt;unknown&gt;" (example_servicers.py:107)
Ticked by node "&lt;unknown&gt;" (example_servicers.py:107)
</code></pre>
<p>and this output from the client:</p>
<pre><code>Servicer stopped with status STATUS_SUCCESS
</code></pre>
<p>To see the servicer actually power the robot off, you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the wasd example to power the robot on and stand it up.</li>
<li>Return wasd's lease with the [l] key</li>
<li>Run the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>You must run the client within 3 seconds of returning wasd's lease, otherwise the normal comms loss policy will kick in.</p>
<h2>Using the example as part of an Autowalk mission</h2>
<p>The example will work as part of an Autowalk mission, performing its action during a callback element. A few extra options are necessary, in order to tell the robot about the new callback service. Here is an example command line, assuming the server is being launched on a Spot CORE attached to a Spot with the default networking setup:</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_service 192.168.50.3 --my-host 192.168.50.5 --directory-host 192.168.50.3 --username USER --password PASSWORD
</code></pre>
<p>The additional options provide details for directory registration, which lets Spot know how to contact your service. <code>192.168.50.5</code> is the address of the host running the service, and <code>192.168.50.3</code> is the address of the robot. You must provide an address that Spot knows how to reach for the <code>--my-host</code> option.</p>
<p>Here is an example command line, assuming the server is being launched on your computer used in earlier examples. Note: You may have to change your firewall settings in order for communication to succeed.</p>
<pre><code>python -m remote_mission_service 192.168.80.3 --my-host &lt;your_ip&gt; --directory-host 192.168.80.3 --username USER --password PASSWORD
</code></pre>
