<h1>API Example - Creating a Custom User Interaction</h1>
<p>This example will allow spot to response to a light shining in its front<br>
left camera.  The following describes what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the robot sitting, shine a light into the front left camera, spot should stand up</li>
<li>shine a light into the front left camera again, spot should start following the light</li>
<li>remove the light, spot should sit down</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Both the light detection and controller is very crude.  One needs to have a very steady<br>
hands and prevent the robot from "seeing" other bright light in the front left camera.</p>
