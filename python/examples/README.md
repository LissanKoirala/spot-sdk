The programming examples included in this directory cover various aspects of the Spot API from an [introduction to commanding Spot through Python](hello_spot/README.md) to [incorporating a tensorflow model](spot_tensorflow_detector/README.md) to [registration of payloads](self_registration/README.md). Check out each example's README for information on how to run and what the code accomplishes.

Boston Dynamics recommends completing the [QuickStart guide](../../docs/python/quickstart.md) before running examples in order to learn essential concepts for using the SDK.
