<h1>Spot SDK</h1>
<p>Develop applications and payloads for Spot using the Boston Dynamics Spot SDK.</p>
<p>The SDK consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spot <a href="docs/python/index.html">Python client library</a>. Applications using the Python library can control Spot and read sensor and health information from Spot. A wide variety of example programs and a QuickStart guide are also included.</li>
<li>The Spot API <a href="docs/concepts/index.html">Conceptual Documentation</a>. These documents explain the key abstractions used by the Spot API.</li>
<li>The Spot <a href="docs/payload/index.html">Payload Developer Guide</a>. Payloads add additional sensing, communication, and control capabilities beyond what the base platform provides. The Payload ICD covers the mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces that Spot supports.</li>
<li>The Spot API <a href="docs/protobuf/index.html">protocol definition</a>. This reference guide covers the details of the protocol applications used to communicate to Spot. Application Developers who wish to use a language beyond Python can implement clients which speak the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is version 2.0.0 of the SDK. Please review the <a href="docs/release_notes.html">Release Notes</a> to see what has changed.</p>
