<h1><a href="../../../index.html">Spot SDK</a> &gt; <a href="../index.html">Concepts</a> &gt; <a href="index.html">Autonomy</a> &gt; <br> GraphNav and Robot Locomotion</h1>
<p>The GraphNav service provides two RPCs for navigating to different locations on the prior map:</p>
<ul>
<li>NavigateTo</li>
<li>NavigateRoute</li>
</ul>
<p>Both RPCs let the client specify maximum speed as well as the size of the goal region at the final waypoint.</p>
<h2>NavigateTo</h2>
<p>NavigateTo is the simplest way to command a robot to go to a destination on the map once the robot is localized. GraphNav will decide which route to take, currently the one with the fewest number of edges.</p>
<h2>NavigateRoute</h2>
<p>The NavigateRoute RPC allows the client to directly specify the path of the robot. This lets the client command the robot to take a longer path as needed. Routes are specified as a list of waypoints and edges. For example, you could make a path that doubles back on itself, allowing the robot to go to a distant waypoint and then back to the start.</p>
<p>Clients that maintain contact with the robot are encouraged to continuously resend the command with a deadline in the near future. This results in the robot stopping quickly if the client stops checking in. Clients that disconnect from an autonomous robot should set a longer deadline and rely on an alternate mechanism to maintain safety.</p>
<h2>Status and feedback</h2>
<p>API clients should periodically query for navigation status during map replay using the NavigationFeedback RPC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless an error is returned, NavigationFeedbackResponse is returned with status STATUS_FOLLOWING_ROUTE and the remaining list of waypoints and edges in the route. ~~~~</li>
<li>On successful completion, the navigation status changes to STATUS_REACHED_GOAL when the robot reaches the end of the commanded route, matching both the position and yaw of the final waypoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients requiring high precision should check localization with GetLocalizationState even after reaching the goal, as the robot will be close but not exactly on the goal.</p>
<h2>Autonomous navigation errors</h2>
<p>The following error types can interrupt an autonomous route:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>STATUS_NO_ROUTE
   </td>
   <td>Indicates the client changed something that invalidated the route.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_NO_LOCALIZATION
   </td>
   <td>The robot is not localized to the map.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_NOT_LOCALIZED_TO_ROUTE
   </td>
   <td>Localized and not lost but not on the commanded route.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_COMMAND_OVERRIDDEN
   </td>
   <td>A new GraphNav command has overridden the command that the user is asking for feedback about.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_LOST
   </td>
   <td>LOST means the robot is no longer confident in its localization, and must be re-localized.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_STUCK
   </td>
   <td>STUCK means that the robot is still localized but is having trouble reaching the destination (usually because of an obstacle in the way).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_ROBOT_FROZEN <br>
STATUS_ROBOT_FAULTED
   </td>
   <td>Indicates the robot fell or has a hardware problem.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_CONSTRAINT_FAULT
   </td>
   <td>Indicates the route is over-constrained. Choose a different route.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_LEASE_ERROR
   </td>
   <td>Indicates the lease given to GraphNav is no longer valid.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>STATUS_COMMAND_TIMED_OUT
   </td>
   <td>Indicates a comms problem or the timeout deadline was reached.
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
