<h1><a href="../../index.html">Spot SDK</a> &gt; <a href="index.html">Concepts</a> &gt; Base Services</h1>
<p>This document assumes knowledge of material covered in the <a href="networking.html">networking</a> document.</p>
<p>The Base Services provide the architectural glue used by the rest of the Spot API. Base Services include authentication, service discovery, and time synchronization. Many applications will use the Base Services when starting up, before moving to using services higher in the stack such as Robot State, Robot Commands, and Autonomy.</p>
<h2>robot-id</h2>
<p>The <code>robot-id</code> service provides metadata about the Spot being communicated with, and is usually the first service accessed when bootstrapping a connection to Spot. The metadata is encoded in a <code>RobotId</code> message, as seen below:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-protobuf"><pre><span class="pl-c">/// Robot identity information, which should be static while robot is powered-on.</span>
<span class="pl-k">message</span> <span class="pl-en">RobotId</span> {
    <span class="pl-c">/// A unique string identifier for the particular robot.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">serial_number</span> = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
 
    <span class="pl-c">/// Type of robot.  E.g., 'spot'.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">species</span> = <span class="pl-c1">2</span>;
 
    <span class="pl-c">/// Robot version/platform.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">version</span> = <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;
 
    <span class="pl-c">/// Version information about software running on the robot.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">RobotSoftwareRelease</span> <span class="pl-smi">software_release</span> = <span class="pl-c1">4</span>;
 
    <span class="pl-c">/// Optional, customer-supplied nickname.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">nickname</span> = <span class="pl-c1">5</span>;
 
    <span class="pl-c">/// Computer Serial Number. Unlike serial_number, which identifies a complete robot,</span>
    <span class="pl-c">///  the computer_serial_number identifies the computer hardware used in the robot.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">computer_serial_number</span> = <span class="pl-c1">6</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p>Examples of ways applications can use the <code>robot-id</code> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying the <code>nickname</code> in a list of possible Spots to connect to. Note that the same Spot can change <code>nickname</code> over time, or multiple Spots can share the same <code>nickname</code>.</li>
<li>Using the <code>serial_number</code> as a key for cached username/passwords or other data about the Spot. The <code>serial_number</code> will never change over time, and is guaranteed to be unique.</li>
<li>Checking the <code>software_release</code> version to determine if the application is compatible with the Spot, or to possibly change behavior depending on Spot software version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike nearly all other services, the <code>robot-id</code> service does not require an authenticated user to access it. This is because the <code>RobotId</code> data includes information which can be helpful for the authentication sequence - such as the Software Version running, or a serial number which can help find user credentials.</p>
<h2>auth</h2>
<p>The <code>auth</code> service is used to authenticate a user to Spot. A successful authentication attempt returns a user token which must be included in RPCs to all services other than <code>robot-id</code> and <code>auth</code> to get access. The user token is a <a href="https://jwt.io" rel="nofollow">JWT</a> token which is valid for 12 hours and can only be used for accessing services on the Spot which issued it - the token isn’t transferable to other Spots.</p>
<p>There are two ways to authenticate a user:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a username and password combination. The usernames and passwords are the same as those managed by the on-robot web server.</li>
<li>By refreshing an existing valid user token. This approach can be used to support a long-lived client application which wants to minimize prompts for username/password.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, an application token must also be included in the authentication request. An application token is issued by Boston Dynamics and authorizes developers to access services on Spot. If the application token has expired, the authentication will not succeed. <code>STATUS_INVALID_APPLICATION_TOKEN</code> or <code>STATUS_EXPIRED_APPLICATION_TOKEN</code> will be the return status code in these cases. The Python client warns when the application token will expire soon, but other developers may need to inspect.</p>
<p>The <code>auth</code> service rate limits invalid authentication attempts for a user to prevent a network attacker from trying to guess users or passwords. If there are more than 6 bad authentication attempts for a user in a row, authentication is locked out for the user for 1 minute. <code>STATUS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED_OUT</code> is returned in this case, and applications should back off when that happens.</p>
<h2>directory</h2>
<p>Spot’s API consists of a variety of services. Some of these services ship with Spot, and some of the services are provided by payloads or applications running on Spot CORE. The <code>directory</code> service is used to discover which services are currently running on Spot.</p>
<p>Note that if an application is built with the Python client library and only using built-in services, it may never directly need to directly access the <code>directory</code> service. However, under the hood the Python client library uses the <code>directory</code> service to set up connections to the built-in services.</p>
<p>Services are described by the <code>ServiceEntry</code> message, and can be listed using the <code>ListServiceEntries</code> RPC. The command-line utility included in the Python library is a quick way to list these options</p>
<pre><code>$ py.exe -3 -m bosdyn.client my-spot dir list 
name                                  type                                               authority                             tokens 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
auth                                  bosdyn.api.AuthService                             auth.spot.robot
directory                             bosdyn.api.DirectoryService                        api.spot.robot                        user
directory-registration                bosdyn.api.DirectoryRegistrationService            api.spot.robot                        user 
estop                                 bosdyn.api.EstopService                            estop.spot.robot                      user 
graph-nav-service                     bosdyn.api.graph_nav.GraphNavService               graph-nav.spot.robot                  user
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>name</code> of the service is a user friendly name which provides some semantic information about what the service can do. The name must be unique across all services. For example, <code>auth</code> is the name of the service which provides authentication.</p>
<p>The <code>type</code> of the service is the gRPC service interface that the service implements. For example, <code>bosdyn.api.AuthService</code> is the type of the <code>auth</code> service. Multiple services can exist for the same type (although with different names and authorities). For example, a camera payload could host a <code>bosdyn.api.ImageService</code> which shares the same interface as the one built into Spot.</p>
<p>The <code>authority</code> is used to direct the RPC request to the correct service. The combination of the <code>authority</code> and the <code>type</code> of the service create a URL. For example, the <code>auth</code> service has a URL of <code>https://auth.spot.robot/bosdyn.api.AuthService</code> (this naming scheme is defined by gRPC itself). All authorities must be of the form <code>&lt;authority-name&gt;.spot.robot</code>. Multiple services of different types can share the same authority.</p>
<p>Services specify whether a user token is needed to access the service. This is demonstrated in the <code>tokens</code> column in the example above. Most services require a signed in user, but a few do not.</p>
<p>Note that not all services register with the <code>directory</code> service at Spot startup, and applications may need to periodically poll the <code>directory</code> service to catch changes that have been made. Built-in services may take a few seconds to register at system startup, and payload provided services may register significantly later.</p>
<h2>time-sync</h2>
<p>Time is critical for both interpreting when sensor data was recorded, as well as commanding Spot. All of the Spot API uses a single clock, or “Robot Time”, as a basis for time commands.</p>
<p>However, Spot’s clock may not be the same as the application’s clock. For example, at a single point in time Spot may think it is 16:01, whereas the application’s clock may be an hour behind at 15:01. If the application treated Spot’s clock as being at the same time as its own clock, problems may ensure. Fresh sensor data from Spot would be interpreted as being generated in the future. Commands that are issued to expire in 10 seconds would be rejected by Spot since they appear to have expired an hour ago.</p>
<p>The <code>time-sync</code> service is used to estimate the offset between the application’s clock and Spot’s clock. Once an offset is calculated, applications can convert times recorded in Spot’s clock to the application’s clock and vice-versa. Neither Spot’s clock nor the application’s clock are directly set using the <code>time-sync</code> service.</p>
<p>Applications built with the Python library can use the <code>TimeSyncThread</code> to simplify interaction with the <code>time-sync</code> service. The <code>TimeSyncThread</code> spawns a background thread which establishes an initial offset estimation, and periodically updates the estimation to avoid drift issues. It also exposes a number of methods to convert time or determine what the current estimate is. See the <a href="../../python/examples/time_sync/index.html">time_sync example</a> for an example of how to use the <code>TimeSyncThread</code>.</p>
