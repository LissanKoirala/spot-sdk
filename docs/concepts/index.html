<p>The Spot API lets applications control Spot, read sensor information, and create and integrate payloads. The Spot API follows a client-server model, where client applications communicate to services running on Spot over a network connection. The following diagram provides the high-level overview of the components involved.</p>

<p>The client applications (shown at the bottom) can run on tablets, laptops, the cloud, or even on payloads connected to Spot, as long as they can establish a network connection to Spot. The network connection can be any IP network - a direct WiFi or ethernet connection to the robot, intranet, or even the Internet. Spot implements the API as a variety of network services, such as the “image” service or the “robot-command” service. Higher layers of the service stack - such as autonomy services - are built on top of services at the lower layer of the stack. Finally, payloads allow for expansion of services beyond those provided by Spot itself - for example, Spot CAM offers a variety of services to control stream quality or the LED lights.</p>
