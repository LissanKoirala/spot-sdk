<h1><a href="../../index.html">Spot SDK</a> &gt; <a href="index.html">Concepts</a> &gt; Networking</h1>
<p>All applications speak to Spot's API over a network connection. Understanding the networking protocols is critical to debugging issues and creating a robust, high-performant application.</p>
<h2>Network Choice</h2>
<p>Spot offers a variety of networking options to support a diverse set of applications and environments. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spot as a connected peer</strong>. Applications can be deployed on computers that physically connect to Spot via the rear RJ-45 port, the DB-25 payload port, or the RJ-45 port on a GXP. This provides a reliable, high-rate communications link without infrastructure requirements, but limits where the application can be run.</li>
<li><strong>Spot as a WiFi access point</strong>. Applications with physical proximity to Spot can connect to the WiFi access point and communicate directly without any networking infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Spot as a WiFi client</strong>. Spot can join an existing WiFi network, and applications can also join the same WiFi network to talk to Spot. This approach increases the possible range between application and Spot, but attention needs to be paid to dead zones in the network, handoff times between access points, and other considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Spot via custom communications links</strong>. Custom communication links such as Persistent Systems radios can act as a bridge between Spot and applications. These can be useful when the above cases are insufficient for network design.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the application-layer protocol for the Spot API works across any IP-based network connection, the examples above show that networking choice can have a large impact on the performance and reliability of an application as well as deployment strategies.</p>
<h2>gRPC and Protocol Buffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://grpc.io" rel="nofollow">gRPC</a> is the application-level protocol used by the majority of the Spot API. gRPC was chosen because it provides a secure, performant protocol with support for a broad set of programming languages and environments.</p>
<p>gRPC specifies service interfaces and RPCs which the service supports. For example, the Spot API has an authentication service with the following definition:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-protobuf"><pre><span class="pl-k">service</span> <span class="pl-en">AuthService</span> {
    rpc GetAuthToken(GetAuthTokenRequest) returns (GetAuthTokenResponse) {}
}</pre></div>
<p>The service interface's name is <code>AuthService</code>. It only supports a single RPC named <code>GetAuthToken</code>, which checks the passed in username and password and returns a session token if they are valid.</p>
<p>The input (GetAuthTokenRequest) and output (GetAuthTokenResponse) messages are <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview" rel="nofollow">Protocol Buffer</a> messages. Protocol Buffer messages have a compact wire representation, support backwards/forwards compatibility, and are implemented for a broad set of programming languages and environments.</p>
<p>Protocol Buffer messages are defined using a language independent format, with automatically generated serialization/deserialization bindings for languages. For example, the definition for <code>GetAuthTokenRequest</code> can be seen below (or at <a href="../../protos/bosdyn/api/auth.proto">auth.proto</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-protobuf"><pre><span class="pl-k">message</span> <span class="pl-en">GetAuthTokenRequest</span> {
    <span class="pl-c">// Common request header.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">RequestHeader</span> <span class="pl-smi">header</span> = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
    <span class="pl-c">// Username to authenticate with. Must be set if password is set.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">username</span> = <span class="pl-c1">2</span>;
    <span class="pl-c">// Password to authenticate with. Not necessary if token is set.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">password</span> = <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;
    <span class="pl-c">// Token to authenticate with. Can be used in place of the password, to re-mint a token.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">token</span> = <span class="pl-c1">4</span>;
    <span class="pl-c">// Application Token accompanying authentication. This must be present.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">application_token</span> = <span class="pl-c1">5</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p>Although the <code>AuthService</code> example showed the common RPC paradigm of single request/single response, gRPC also supports more advanced RPC paradigms such as streaming requests, streaming responses, or full bidirectional streaming.  The Spot API uses some of the more advanced paradigms in select locations. For example, gRPC limits responses to 4MB by default, which is too small for high-quality images. The image service provides a streaming response RPC to work around this limitation.</p>
<h2>Using gRPC and Protocol Buffers</h2>
<p>The Python library included in the SDK hides the use of gRPC and Protocol Buffers and provides a simpler abstraction. For example, the <code>AuthClient</code> class - which speaks to the <code>AuthService</code> interface described above - has a method called auth demonstrated below.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre>    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">auth</span>(<span class="pl-smi"><span class="pl-smi">self</span></span>, <span class="pl-smi">username</span>, <span class="pl-smi">password</span>, <span class="pl-smi">app_token</span>, <span class="pl-k">**</span><span class="pl-smi">kwargs</span>):
        <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"""</span>Authenticate to the robot with a username/password combo.</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">        Params:</span>
<span class="pl-s">            username -- username on the robot.</span>
<span class="pl-s">            password -- password for the username on the robot.</span>
<span class="pl-s">            app_token -- the application token needed for auth. Note that this is extraneous for robots with old software.</span>
<span class="pl-s">            kwargs -- extra arguments for controlling RPC details.</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">        Returns:</span>
<span class="pl-s">            User token from the server as a string.</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">        Raises:</span>
<span class="pl-s">            InvalidLoginError: If username and/or password are not valid.</span>
<span class="pl-s">        <span class="pl-pds">"""</span></span>
        req <span class="pl-k">=</span> _build_auth_request(username, password, app_token)
        <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-c1">self</span>.call(<span class="pl-c1">self</span>._stub.GetAuthToken, req, _token_from_response, _error_from_response,
                         <span class="pl-k">**</span>kwargs)</pre></div>
<p>This method takes <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, and <code>app_token</code> strings and generates a <code>GetAuthTokenRequest</code> message from those using <code>_build_auth_request</code>. The RPC is then sent to the <code>AuthService</code>, and a <code>GetAuthTokenResponse</code> is received. If the authentication attempt is valid, the session token is returned to the caller of the auth function. If there were networking issues or the username/password combination was invalid, an exception is raised.</p>
<p>This layer of abstraction simplifies common use cases, but developers will occasionally need to interact with Protocol Buffer messages directly, even when using the Python library. For example, the <code>RobotState</code> message includes many nested sub-messages and detailed information. Rather than convert into primitive types or other data structures, developers need to directly operate on the protocol buffer itself. The message definition and comments (at <a href="../../protos/bosdyn/api/robot_state.proto">protos/bosdyn/api/robot_state.proto</a>) are key to understanding what is included and how to interpret the data.</p>
<p>Developers who wish to support another language or environment are also able to build client libraries using the gRPC service definitions and Protocol Buffer message definitions. The Python client library may also be used as a reference implementation.</p>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>Robust applications need to handle errors when communicating with the Spot API. There are three general classes of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Networking errors</strong>. Examples: network timeouts, inability to reach Spot, or security issues. The workaround is typically networking configuration specific.</li>
<li><strong>Common RPC errors</strong>. Examples: invalid input, or internal server errors. Typically the root cause is buggy application code and the only workaround is to fix the bug.</li>
<li><strong>Specific RPC errors</strong>. An example with the <code>AuthService</code> above is a bad username/password combination. Application code should handle these errors gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detail can be seen in the <code>GetAuthTokenResponse</code> Protocol Buffer message below:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-protobuf"><pre><span class="pl-k">message</span> <span class="pl-en">GetAuthTokenResponse</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">ResponseHeader</span> <span class="pl-smi">header</span> = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
    <span class="pl-k">enum</span> <span class="pl-en">Status</span>{
        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_UNKNOWN should never be used. If used, an internal error has happened.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_UNKNOWN</span> = <span class="pl-c1">0</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_OK indicates that authentication has succeeded. The |token| field will</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// be populated with a session token that can be used to authenticate the user.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_OK</span> = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_INVALID_LOGIN indicates that authentication has failed since an invalid</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// username and/or password were provided.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_INVALID_LOGIN</span> = <span class="pl-c1">2</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_INVALID_TOKEN indicates that authentication has failed since the |token|</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// provided in the request is invalid. Reasons for the token being invalid could be</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// because it has expired, because it is improperly formed, for the wrong robot, the</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// user that the token is for has changed a password, or many other reasons. Clients</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// should use username/password-based authentication when refreshing the token fails.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_INVALID_TOKEN</span> = <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED_OUT indicates that authentication has failed since</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// authentication for the user is temporarily locked out due to too many unsuccessful</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// attempts. Any new authentication attempts should be delayed so they may happen after</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// the lock out period ends.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED_OUT</span> = <span class="pl-c1">4</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_INVALID_APPLICATION_TOKEN indicates that the |application_token| in the</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// request was invalid.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_INVALID_APPLICATION_TOKEN</span> = <span class="pl-c1">5</span>;

        <span class="pl-c">// STATUS_EXPIRED_APPLICATION_TOKEN indicates that the |application_token| in the</span>
        <span class="pl-c">// request was valid, but has expired.</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">STATUS_EXPIRED_APPLICATION_TOKEN</span> = <span class="pl-c1">6</span>;
    }
    <span class="pl-c1">Status</span> <span class="pl-smi">status</span> = <span class="pl-c1">2</span>;

    <span class="pl-c">// Token data. Only specified if status == STATUS_OK.</span>
    <span class="pl-k">string</span> <span class="pl-smi">token</span> = <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p>The networking errors are not defined in the message and happen lower in the gRPC stack. The Specific RPC errors are handled by the <code>Status</code> enum shown above. Throughout the API, the <code>Status</code> enum follows the pattern of 0 being undefined (due to how Protocol Buffers represent unset data), 1 representing an <code>OK</code> or success response, and 2+ representing error codes specific to the RPC. For example, <code>STATUS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED_OUT</code> is used if there have been too many password attempts for a user and the account is locked out for a short period.</p>
<p>Common RPC errors such as invalid input are not directly shown above. A case of invalid input would be a <code>GetAuthTokenRequest</code> which includes no username or password at all - something which is indicative of buggy client code rather than bad user input. Common RPC errors are shown in the <code>ResponseHeader</code> message below which all Spot API responses include:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-protobuf"><pre><span class="pl-c">/// Standard header attached to all GRPC responses from services.</span>
<span class="pl-k">message</span> <span class="pl-en">ResponseHeader</span> {
    <span class="pl-c">/// Echo-back the RequestHeader for timing information, etc....</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">RequestHeader</span> <span class="pl-smi">request_header</span> = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;

    <span class="pl-c">/// Time that the request was received. The server clock is the time basis.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">google.protobuf.Timestamp</span> <span class="pl-smi">request_received_timestamp</span> = <span class="pl-c1">2</span>;

    <span class="pl-c">/// Time that the response was received. The server clock is the time basis.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">google.protobuf.Timestamp</span> <span class="pl-smi">response_timestamp</span> = <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;

    <span class="pl-c">/// Common errors, such as invalid input or internal server problems.</span>
    <span class="pl-c">/// If there is a common error, the rest of the response message outside of the</span>
    <span class="pl-c">/// ResponseHeader will be invalid.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">CommonError</span> <span class="pl-smi">error</span> = <span class="pl-c1">4</span>;

    <span class="pl-c">/// Echoed request message. In some cases it may not be present, or it may be a stripped</span>
    <span class="pl-c">/// down representation of the request.</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">google.protobuf.Any</span> <span class="pl-smi">request</span> = <span class="pl-c1">5</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p>The Python library handles Networking, Common RPC errors, and Specific RPC errors by raising specific Exceptions, which application developers can accept.</p>
<h2>HTTP/2, TLS, and TCP</h2>
<p>gRPC is built on top of other networking protocols, as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="network_protocol_stack.png"><img src="network_protocol_stack.png" alt="Network Protocol Stack" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>This protocol stack has a few implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP/2 supports multiplexing multiple gRPC calls over the same network connection. Responses can come back in a different order than received, and a low priority response can be interrupted by a higher priority response and then resumed later. gRPC requests map directly to HTTP/2 requests.</li>
<li>All communication is over a secure, encrypted TLS channel (TLS1.2 or TLS1.3 are supported). Network attackers can not read or manipulate data between the application and Spot. Client libraries should also verify that the certificate presented by a server chains up to a Boston Dynamics root certificate to prevent active MITM attacks. The Python client library automatically does this certificate verification approach.</li>
<li>Communication is over a reliable transport layer with TCP. Reliable transport is a good approach for non-real-time RPCs such as authenticating to Spot, and is also not problematic for real-time cases where there is a strong networking link such as through the RJ45 or DB-25 connectors. However, it can be problematic when handling real-time RPCs over a spotty network connection. There are some short-term mitigation approaches around this such as maintaining a socket pool to round-robin requests over. In the longer term, Boston Dynamics is exploring other approaches (such as gRPC over QUIC or HTTP/3) to improve communications over poor network links.</li>
<li>The protocol stack is a very common one for the Internet at large. This has two benefits. First, Spot is able to use battle-tested implementations of the protocols which can withstand adversarial attackers. Second, there is a very high likelihood that an application can reach Spot over a diverse set of networks without being blocked by intermediate firewalls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Robot Discovery</h2>
<p>To talk to Spot, a client application needs to specify an IP address where a Spot is running. There are a number of possible options for doing this sort of robot discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed IP address</strong>. This approach can be used reliably when connecting directly to Spot as a WiFi access point, or over ethernet. No name lookup infrastructure is required.</li>
<li><strong>DNS name</strong>. A DNS server (or HOSTS file) can be configured to statically point to a fixed IP address that Spot listens on, and the application specifies a DNS name to reach.</li>
<li><strong>mDNS discovery</strong>. Spot will send mDNS/DNS-SD broadcasts starting with the 2.0 release. Clients on the same network can listen for these packets and discover robots that are available via the announcements.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Discovery mechanism</strong>. Applications can develop custom approaches to map a specific Spot to an IP address - such as using a cloud-based discovery endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client applications do not use the symbolic name of the robot (if any) when verifying the certificate during the TLS handshake to the robot. This supports a variety of discovery mechanisms without requiring new certificates to be provisioned.</p>
