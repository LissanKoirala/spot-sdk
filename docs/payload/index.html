<h2>Introduction to Spot payloads</h2>
<p>Boston Dynamics designed Spot as a versatile sensing and manipulation platform. Spot supports up to two payloads and an arm to provide application-specific functionality. Two ports provide electrical and data interfaces for payloads. Mounting rails provide mechanical attachment points.</p>
<p>A payload is any device attached to the robot. Many payloads will connect to the robot to access power and data interfaces. Non-interactive payloads are also supported.</p>
<p>The complexity of payload integration with the Spot platform ranges from:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Light</em> — Attaching an inert payload to the back of the robot without connecting to the robot's payload ports or network.</li>
<li><em>Medium</em> — The payload connects to a payload port and uses some or all of the services provided by the robot.</li>
<li><em>Heavy</em> — A payload that registers and provides standard services that integrate with other components of the robot system, such as the tablet driving interface, or other payloads.</li>
</ul>
