<h1><a href="../../index.html">Spot SDK</a> &gt; Python Library</h1>
<p>The Python library is used by applications to control Spot, read sensor information, and register payload services.</p>
<h2>Using the Python Library</h2>
<p>The <a href="quickstart.html">Python QuickStart</a> is the recommended way to get started using the Python library. It is a step-by-step guide that will get the Python libraries installed and running simple programs to control Spot.</p>
<p><a href="understanding_spot_programming.html">Understanding Spot Programming</a> goes deeper than the QuickStart and covers some of the key concepts of developing applications for Spot.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../python/examples/index.html">example programs</a> demonstrate how to use the Python library, and can be used as reference programs for your own applications.</p>
<p>The <a href="reference/index.html">Python reference guide</a> documents all of the Python modules, classes, and interfaces in detail.</p>
<h3>Supported Platforms and Versions</h3>
<p>The Python client library is supported on the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10</li>
<li>MacOS 10.14 (Mojave and Catalina)</li>
<li>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</li>
</ul>
<p>Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 are supported. Note that Python 3.8 is not supported at this point.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 is <em>not</em> supported, since the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/" rel="nofollow">Python 2 End-Of-Life</a> happened at the start of 2020.</p>
