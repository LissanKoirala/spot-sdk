# Boston Dynamics | Developer

Integrate Boston Dynamics robots into your applications with the Boston Dynamics Developer Toolkit.

The Toolkit consists of:
  * Robot APIs to control the robot and read information about the world.
  * The Python client library and tests.
  * Documentation.
  * Example Programs.

## Python

The [Python QuickStart](docs/python/quickstart.html) is a step-by-step guide that will get you up and running on the Python libraries, and cover a number of key concepts along the way.

The [Python Reference](docs/python/reference/index.html) is a detailed reference manual for API calls.

Example Programs:
  * [Hello, Spot!](python/bosdyn-tutorials/src/bosdyn/tutorials/hello_spot.py) provides a basic template for issuing simple commands to Spot.
  * [WASD](python/bosdyn-tutorials/src/bosdyn/tutorials/wasd.py) is an interactive terminal-based program for controlling Spot via the keyboard. It demonstrates more advanced use of the command system.
  * The [Command Line](python/bosdyn-client/src/bosdyn/client/command_line.py) tool lets you inspect the state of the robot, and demonstrates how to handle errors well.
