# Boston Dynamics | Developer

Integrate Boston Dynamics robots into your applications with the Boston Dynamics Developer Toolkit.

The Toolkit consists of:
  * Robot APIs to control the robot and read information about the world.
  * The Python client library and tests.
  * Documentation.
  * Example Programs.

## Python

### Supported Platforms and Versions

The Python client library is supported on the following platforms:
  * Windows 10
  * MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 are supported. Note that Python 3.8 is not supported at this point.

Python 2.7 is _not_ supported. The [Python 2 End-Of-Life](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) is coming at the beginning of 2020, and Python developers are encouraged to move to Python 3.

### Documentation and tutorials

The [Python QuickStart](docs/python/quickstart.md) is a step-by-step guide that will get you up and running on the Python libraries, and cover a number of key concepts along the way.

The [Python Reference](docs/python/reference/index.html) is a detailed reference manual for API calls.

Example Programs:
  * [Hello, Spot!](python/examples/hello_spot/hello_spot.py) provides a basic template for issuing simple commands to Spot.
  * [WASD](python/examples/wasd/wasd.py) is an interactive terminal-based program for controlling Spot via the keyboard. It demonstrates more advanced use of the command system.
  * The [Command Line](python/bosdyn-client/src/bosdyn/client/command_line.py) tool lets you inspect the state of the robot, and demonstrates how to handle errors well.
