# Spot SDK

Develop applications and payloads for Spot using the Boston Dynamics Spot SDK.

The SDK consists of:
  * The Spot [Python client library](docs/python/README.md). Applications using the Python library can control Spot and read sensor and health information from Spot. A wide variety of example programs and a QuickStart guide are also included.
  * The Spot API [Conceptual Documentation](docs/concepts/README.md). These documents explain the key abstractions used by the Spot API.
  * The Spot [Payload Developer Guide](docs/payload/README.md). Payloads add additional sensing, communication, and control capabilities beyond what the base platform provides. The Payload ICD covers the mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces that Spot supports.
  * The Spot API [protocol definition](docs/protobuf/index.html). This reference guide covers the details of the protocol applications used to communicate to Spot. Application Developers who wish to use a language beyond Python can implement clients which speak the protocol.

This is version 2.0.0 of the SDK. Please review the [Release Notes](docs/release_notes.md) to see what has changed.
